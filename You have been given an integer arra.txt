You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N that contains only integers, 0 and 1. Write a function to sort this array/list. Think of a solution which scans the array/list only once and don't require use of an extra array/list.

Note:
You need to change in the given array/list itself. Hence, no need to return or print anything. 

void sortZeroesAndOne(int *input, int size)
{
    //Write your code here
    int i=0,j=size-1;
    while(i<j){
      if (input[i] > input[j]) {
        swap(input[i], input[j]);
        i++,j--;
      }
      else if (input[i]==0) i++;
      else if (input[j]==1) j--;
    }

}
